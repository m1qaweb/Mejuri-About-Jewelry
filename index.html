          jewelry, objects of personal a dornment prized for the craftsmanship
          going into their creation and generally for the va lue of their
          components as well. Claddagh ring Claddagh ring Throughout the
          centuries and from culture to culture, the materials considered rare
          and beautiful hav e ranged from shells, bones, pebbles, tusks, claws,
          a nd wood to so-called precious metals, precious and sem iprecious
          stones, pearls, corals, enamels, vitreous pastes , and ceramics. In
          certain eras artist-craftsmen have so metimes placed less emphasis on
          the intrinsic value of ma terials than on their aesthetic function as
          components contributin g to the effect of the whole. Thus, they might
          fashion a brooch out of steel or plastic rather than gold or platinum.
          Furthermore, in add ition to its decorative function, during much of
          its history jewelry has also been worn as a sign of social
          rank—forbidden by sumptuary laws to all but the ruling classes—and as
          a talisman to avert evil and bring good luck. During the Middle Ages,
          for example, a ruby r ing was thought to bring its owner lands and
          titles, to bestow virt ue, to protect against seduction, and to
          prevent effervescence in wa ter—but only if worn on the left hand. The
          famed Claddagh ring, a tra ditional Irish ring featuring a heart, a
          crown, and two hands, has lon g symbolized love, loyalty, and
          friendship, respectively. According to Irish custom, the ring s
          positioning on the hand conveys the wearers marital status. It is also
          called the “friendship ring” or “hands and heart ri ng.”

          The first materials used to make objects for personal adornment were
          taken from the animal and vegetable world. The material taken from the
          animal world, in a natural or processed form, constituted the actual
          adornment, whereas vegetable fibres served as its support. A great
          variety of shells and pieces of shell were used during the prehistoric
          age and are still used in certain island and coastal cultures to make
          necklaces, bracelets, pendants, and headdresses. In the inland regions
          the first materials used for personal adornment came from mammoths
          tusks, the horns of reindeer and other animals, and, later on, amber
          and lignite. All materials that have been used over the centuries for
          the manufacture of jewelry have undergone to some extent mechanical,
          physical, or chemical treatment for the purpose of transforming their
          raw shapes into shapes that, in addition to being functional, also
          satisfy certain aesthetic concepts.

          Precious metals and their properties
        </h1>
        <p>
          Of gold’s properties, when it was first discovered (probably in
          Mesopotamia before 3000 bce), it was the metal’s malleability that was
          a new phenomenon: only beeswax, when heated to a certain temperature,
          could be compared to it. Gold’s molecules move and change position in
          accordance with the stresses to which it is submitted, so that when it
          is beaten it gains in surface area what it loses in thickness. In
          modern jewelry, gold can take on a variety of hues when it is alloyed
          with other metals: water green, white, gray, red, and blue.After gold,
          silver is the metal most widely used in jewelry and the most
          malleable. Although known during the Copper Age, silver made only rare
          appearances in jewelry before the Classical age. In general, silver
          was, and still is, used in jewelry for economic reasons or to obtain
          chromatic effects. It was often used in the 17th, 18th, and 19th
          centuries, however, as support in settings for diamonds and other
          transparent precious stones, in order to encourage the reflection of
          light.Another rare metal, whose use in jewelry is fairly recent, is
          platinum. From the 19th century onward this metal was used ever more
          frequently in jewelry because of its white brilliance and
          malleability, as well as its resistance to acids and its high melting
          point. Modern jewelry, such as that designed by early 20th-century
          artists, introduced nonprecious metals such as steel.
        </p>
        <h1 id="Metalwork">Metalwork</h1>
        <p>
          The basic components of jewelry have always consisted of sheet metal,
          metal cast in a mold, and wire (more or less heavy or fine). These
          components take on the desired shape by means of techniques carried
          out with the help of tools. Gold in its natural state was beaten while
          hot or cold and reduced to extremely thin sheets (this operation could
          be performed with stone hammers). The sheets were then cut into the
          desired sizes. Examination of the most ancient pieces of jewelry shows
          that one of the techniques used most widely in decorating metal sheets
          for jewelry was embossing (relief work). Throughout the centuries
          embossing techniques have remained substantially unchanged, although
          in modern times mechanization has made possible mass production of
          decorative parts of jewelry, with great savings of time and labour but
          with a corresponding lack of art. In repoussé the relief is pressed
          (in a negative mold) or hammered out from the reverse side of the gold
          sheet and then finished off on the right side with a hammer or
          engraving tool. For half-modeled or completely round reliefs, the gold
          leaf was pressed onto wooden or bronze models. Completely round
          objects were made in two pieces and then welded together. Another
          embossing, or relief, technique is engraving, which involves
          impressing designs into the metal with a sharp tool. Decorative
          openwork designs can be created by piercing the gold leaf. In the
          Roman period this technique was called opus interassile. Granulation
          is a decorative technique in which small or minute gold balls (with
          diameters ranging from 1/60 to 1/180 of an inch) are used to form
          silhouettes on smooth or embossed metal. Casting from precious metals
          has always been rare. When the relief was to be visible only from one
          side, the metal was poured into the cast and, when hardened, touched
          up with a graver. When the relief was to be fully modeled, the cire
          perdue (lost-wax) process, involving casting from a wax mold, was
          used. Gold and silver wire, according to its function, can be made
          into various sizes, shapes, sections, and weights. It can serve to
          join, to support pendants of varying importance, to make necklaces and
          bracelets, or to alternate with other decorative components. From the
          3rd millennium bce through the present day, chains—ranging from the
          simple type, consisting of a series of round or oval rings, to one of
          the oldest elaborations, the “loop in loop,” or square, chain—have
          offered goldsmiths the widest field for decorative imagination.
          Filigree is a form of decoration made exclusively from fine gold or
          silver wire welded onto the surface of an object made of the same
          metal or done in openwork (without a background). The decoration to be
          carried out is designed first on a model with a flat or curved surface
          identical to that on which the completed filigree is to be welded or
          to the unsupported shape that it must assume. It can be made from
          smooth wire or from a ropelike plait or from a series of small
          hemispheres. A more complicated type of filigree consists of metal
          wire made in the shape of beads called granulated filigree. After
          having been prepared separately, the different parts that make up a
          piece of jewelry are put together. In early jewelry this was done
          mechanically, by inserting beaten pins, by bending and beating the
          parts to be fastened together, or by binding them with gold wire or
          tape. Welding is a technique belonging to a more developed stage of
          ancient gold working (end of the 3rd millennium bce).

        <p>
          In addition to gold, silver, and platinum, the precious materials most
          widely used in jewelry are gems—any precious or semiprecious stone. By
          definition this group also includes some animal and vegetable products
          with precious characteristics, such as amber, pearls, and coral.
          Conventionally, the following are classified as precious stones:
          diamonds, rubies (corundum), emeralds (beryl), and sapphires
          (corundum). To these, however, can be added chrysoberyl, topaz, and
          zircon because of their hardness and their refraction and transparency
          index.
        </p>
        <h1 id="The_properties_of_gems">The properties of gems</h1>
        <p>
          Diamonds have the highest refraction index, and those used for jewels
          are very transparent. Diamonds from Indian deposits were known in
          ancient times; in the West the limited use of diamonds began in the
          late Middle Ages. Diamonds for jewelry are graded on the basis of
          colour from blue-white to yellow. Grading also is done on the basis of
          purity, which varies from perfectly clear, extremely pure stones to
          those with many impurities and flaws. Large demand provided an
          incentive for the production of false diamonds (as well as other
          stones) as early as 1675 in Paris. Mogok rubies, from Myanmar (Burma),
          are the most highly prized because of their bright red colour (called
          pigeon blood). Those from Thailand are usually a more brownish colour,
          while those from Sri Lanka tend toward violet. Production of synthetic
          stones is far greater than the supply of natural rubies. The physical
          and optical properties of synthetic and natural rubies are so similar
          that it is difficult to distinguish between them. The sapphire (blue
          variety of corundum) is considered one of the most valuable of
          precious stones. A sapphire’s colouring usually indicates its origin.
          Those from Myanmar are deep blue. The Kashmir sapphire is cornflower
          blue and is highly prized, being quite rare. Sapphires from Thailand
          are very similar in colour to those from Myanmar; those from Sri Lanka
          are of different shades but incline toward violet. Sapphires, like
          rubies, can be cut so that, in the light, a beautiful, luminous
          six-pointed star appears on the surface of the gem. Star sapphires and
          rubies are semi-opalescent. Synthetic sapphires and rubies are
          produced by the same industries. The green emerald is a precious stone
          used since very ancient times. There is documentation of its presence
          in Egypt during the life of Pharaoh Sesostris III in the 19th century
          bce. At the end of the 16th century, emeralds from South America were
          brought into Europe. On the American continent, the first peoples to
          use emeralds were those belonging to the pre-Columbian civilizations,
          in particular the Inca. In 1935 in the United States (Chatham) and in
          Germany (Farbenindustrie), synthetic emerald crystals were made with
          characteristics similar to natural ones. Among the beryls, mention
          must be made of morganite (pink beryl) found in various shades of
          peach-blossom pink. The main deposits are in California and
          Madagascar. The two best known and most widely used varieties of
          chrysoberyl are alexandrite (transparent) and precious cat’s-eye
          (opaque). Because of its great power of absorption of certain colours,
          alexandrite looks green in daylight and reddish purple in artificial
          light. The cat’s-eye is a yellowish green colour and is characterized
          by a luminous line. The intensity of the light in this line varies
          according to the brightness of the rays of light that strike it.

          Gem engraving, setting, and cutting
        </h1>
        <p>
          The most ancient technique of stone engraving, intaglio-incised
          carving, was probably first used to produce seals. The art is believed
          to have originated in southern Mesopotamia and was highly developed by
          the 4th millennium bce. During the Hellenistic Age (c. 323–30 bce)
          intaglio surface engraving gave rise to the idea of carving stones in
          relief, exploiting the different coloured layers of certain minerals
          to create contrasting figures (cameo): the background was cut down to
          the lower level, of a different colour or shade, in order to make the
          subject stand out chromatically. The stones that have properties
          suited for this purpose are sardonyx, agate, and onyx. The cameo is
          usually one of the components for necklaces, bracelets, and rings or
          is included in medallions with a jeweled frame. The art of cameo in
          jewelry was most highly developed during three periods: the late
          republican to early imperial period in Rome, the Renaissance, and the
          Neoclassical period in the 18th century. The evolution of techniques
          of setting has followed that of stonecutting. The insertion of gems in
          jewelry can be done in various ways. The setting can have a round,
          square, oval, or rectangular collet (rim); in periods in which gems
          were mounted in their own irregular shapes, the collet followed this
          form. Usually, on the inside of the collet a short distance from the
          edge, there is a protrusion on which the stone rests. The edge is
          pounded down around the gem to ensure its stability. In coronet
          settings the form may be conical or pyramidal, solid or pierced. The
          edge is first shaped into a row of teeth, which are later hammered
          down onto the gem in order to hold it in place. Until fairly recently,
          nearly all gems were mounted on a metal base, and transparent stones,
          according to their colour, were placed on a gold or silver base to
          increase the amount of light reflected. As new cuts were developed for
          stones, setting techniques also progressed, especially for those
          jewels in which important stones like diamonds, emeralds, and rubies
          form the main theme. The tendency was to leave the stones as visible
          as possible (especially in rivière necklaces and bracelets made only
          of diamonds) by mounting them with a very small ring of white gold or
          platinum fitted closely against the back of the stone. Three claws,
          attached to this ring, hold the stone in place. Pearls, like some
          coloured stones, in ancient Classical times were pierced with a drill,
          the hole going half or all the way through according to whether the
          pearls were to be strung on a necklace or fastened onto a jewel. Until
          the 15th century, stones were only polished or the part to be left
          visible was rounded into a dome shape called cabochon. The cutting
          known as faceting gradually developed from the first attempts in the
          15th century, probably in France and the Netherlands. During the 16th
          century the simple rose cut began to be used, after which there were
          no new developments until 1640, when, under the patronage of Jules
          Cardinal Mazarin, the first brilliant cut was carried out (also called
          the Mazarin cut). Toward the end of that century, a Venetian succeeded
          in obtaining the triple brilliant cut, which is still used. The
          numerous cuts used for diamonds today are usually applied to other
          precious and semiprecious transparent stones as well. For emeralds,
          rubies, and other coloured stones the square or rectangular cut with a
          stepped bulb or the cabochon cut are usually used.

        <h1 id="Diamonds">Diamonds</h1>
        <p>
          Diamonds were first mined in India. Pliny may have mentioned them,
          although there is some debate as to the exact nature of the stone he
          referred to as Adamas. In 2005, Australia, Botswana, Russia and Canada
          ranked among the primary sources of gemstone diamond production. There
          are negative consequences of the diamond trade in certain areas.
          Diamonds mined during the recent civil wars in Angola, Ivory Coast,
          Sierra Leone, and other nations have been labelled as blood diamonds
          when they are mined in a war zone and sold to finance an
          insurgency.[citation needed] The British crown jewels contain the
          Cullinan Diamond, part of the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever
          found (1905), at 3,106.75 carats (621.35 g). Now popular in engagement
          rings, this usage dates back to the marriage of Maximilian I to Mary
          of Burgundy in 1477. A popular style is the diamond solitaire, which
          features a single large diamond mounted prominently. Within solitaire,
          there are three categories in which a ring can be classified: prong,
          bezel and tension setting.

          The history of jewelry design
        </h1>
        <p>
          The possibility of tracing jewelry’s historic itinerary derives
          primarily from the custom, beginning with the most remote
          civilizations, of burying the dead with their richest garments and
          ornaments. Plastic and pictorial iconography—painting, sculpture,
          mosaic—also offer abundant testimony to the jewelry worn in various
          eras. It is probable that prehistoric humans thought of decorating the
          body before they thought of making use of anything that could suggest
          clothing. Before precious metals were discovered, people who lived
          along the seashore decorated themselves with a great variety of
          shells, fishbones, fish teeth, and coloured pebbles. People who lived
          inland used as ornaments materials from the animals they had killed
          for food: reindeer antlers, mammoth tusks, and all kinds of animal
          bones. After they had been transformed from their natural state into
          various elaborate forms, these materials, together with animal skins
          and bird feathers, provided sufficient decoration. This era was
          followed by one that saw a transition from a nomadic life to a settled
          social order and the subsequent birth of the most ancient
          civilizations. Most peoples settled along the banks of large rivers,
          which facilitated the development of agriculture and animal husbandry.
          Indirectly, this also led to the discovery of virginal alluvial
          deposits of minerals, first among which were gold and precious stones.
          Over the years the limited jewelry forms of prehistoric times
          multiplied until they included ornaments for every part of the body.
          For the head there were crowns, diadems, tiaras, hairpins, combs,
          earrings, nose rings, lip rings, and earplugs. For the neck and torso
          there were necklaces, fibulae (the ancient safety pin), brooches,
          pectorals (breastplates), stomachers, belts, and watch fobs. For the
          arms and hands armlets, bracelets, and rings were fashioned. For the
          thighs, legs, and feet craftsmen designed thigh bracelets, ankle
